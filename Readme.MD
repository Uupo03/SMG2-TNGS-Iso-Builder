**__Thank you for using my Iso Builder for SMG2, The New Gree Stars__**

**What it is**

A iso builder for The New Green Stars, a SMG2 mod.

**Requirements**

Wiimm's ISO Tools (or WIT for short), you can get it here: https://wit.wiimm.de/

**USAGE**

- Place a .iso file (.wbfs, .wdf, .wia and some other formats also supported) of SMG2 into the iso builder folder and run Builder.bat.

- There are instructions on-screen but if you just want an .iso to use on dolphin:
	1. Choose 1, 2, 3 or 4  (in this case choose 1).
	2. Type in the name of your SMG2 disc image (e. g. SMG2.iso).
	3. Type in a name for the new, modded SMG2 disc image. (e. g. SMG2_Modded.iso)
	4. Wait until the modded disc image finishes building.
